# embedded-spinny

If you have drivers that implement `embedded-hal-async` traits, then you can use
`embedded-spinny` adapter types to get spinning, blocking I/O for free. Same
goes for `embedded-io-async` and `embedded-io`. By designing to common
interfaces, `embedded-spinny` can be used across multiple HALs.

For more information, see the package documentation.
